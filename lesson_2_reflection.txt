What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

It creates all of the meta data to track your changes. If you don't do it, you're project won't be tracked by git.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?

It is an intermediate stage for files you've changed, waiting to be commited to the actually repository, whereas working directory and repository already have files that have been saved and changed. Stage area can be wiped out.  

What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?

If you have a major change or feature you want to add you can create a new branch and it will be easier to see a major change was added at the point in time the branch was created. Whereas, if the change was committed on the master branch it would not be as obvious.
