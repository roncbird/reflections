How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

The plus and minus signs draws your eyes quickly to the differences and makes it easy to find.

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?

I would be able to quickly reverse changes that caused bugs or problems, or retrieve lost changes that were not intended to be deleted
